        a. Some text already exists on page, such as _ in place of letters in word to be guessed,
            the words 'letters guessed' and '10 chances' plus any decorations.
    2. When you press a button, it adds a letter to the screen.
        a. if you are correct, the letter appears within the word, replacing _
        b. if you are incorrect, the letter appears on your list of used letters, and removes 1 chance
    3. Every time you press a button and it is not in the word, you lose a chance.
    4. Chances are not used if you guess a letter correctly.
    5. If you guess the word by getting all the letters before running out of chances, then you win! Music plays.
    6. If you do not guess the word before your chances reach 0, then you lose. Sadface.
