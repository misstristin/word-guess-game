This readme is being added late due to the fact that I did not see that requirement - better late than never.

This project is a word guess game that takes user input in the form of letters and tells if the letter guessed is in the hidden word.
If you guess the word in 10 tries, then you win.
If you don't guess the word in 10 tries, you lose.

This project is useful because it demonstrates basic understanding of Javascript and is a fun way for the user to experience a traditional
hang man game.

This project is maintained by Tristin Tobias (misstristin).
